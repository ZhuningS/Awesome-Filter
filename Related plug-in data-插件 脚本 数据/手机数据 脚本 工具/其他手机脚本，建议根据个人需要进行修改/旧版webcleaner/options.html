				<input type = "radio" name = "text_on" value = "false">Off
				
			</form>
			<br>
			<p> The Text Filter works by searching for the words listed below in within the document. When it finds one of these words, it will replace it with '*'s.
			Also, the filter will 'expand' the words, blocking a word if any part of that word appears in the list below. In other words, if you listed 'both' as a blocked word,
			then the word 'bother' will also be blocked, since the word 'both' appears in 'bother'. Any websites entered into the 'Whitelisted Websites' box will not be filtered.</p>
			
			<!-- Container div for the two input boxes, so that they can go side-by-side and then other options can

			<p> The Image Filter works by searching an image name and search tags for any of the words listed below in the 'Words to Block Images On' box.
			If a match is found, then the image will be blocked. As with the Text Filter, the words are expanded, so if a listed word appears as part of a word that
			in the image name or tag, then the image will still be blocked. Any websites entered into the 'Whitelisted Websites' box will not be filtered. </p>

			<p> The Image Scanner is an additional option to the Image Filter. When turned on, if an image passes the Image Filter, it will be passed
			into a scanner, where the number of skin pixels will be detected. Then, the number of skin pixels will be compared to the total number of pixels in the image
			with the result being a percentage. If this percentage is above the percentage specified by the slider bar, then the image will be blocked.
			<br>
			<br>
			NOTE: Due to the nature of this scanner, when it is working properly it may block close-up facial images.
